    "The US has confirmed for the first time that it has been flying unarmed surveillance drones over Gaza.Pentagon spokesman Brig Gen Pat Ryder said the drones were operating in \"support of hostage recovery efforts\".\"These UAV flights began after the Oct 7 attack by Hamas on Israel,\" he said in a brief statement.The acknowledgement comes after reporters spotted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) on flight-tracking websites.\"The US is conducting unarmed UAV flights over Gaza, as well as providing advice and assistance to support our Israeli partner as they work on their hostage recovery efforts,\" the Pentagon's statement on Friday said.The confirmation comes after reporters spotted MQ-9 Reapers, usually operated by American special forces, circling Gaza on Flightradar24, a publicly available flight-tracking website.Reaper drones have previously been deployed to conduct airstrikes in Afghanistan, but are primarily used as surveillance aircraft because of their ability to \"loiter\" above an area for more than 20 hours at a time.Unnamed US military officials told the New York Times that the drones were not helping co-ordinate Israeli military action in and around Gaza. Officials told the newspaper that information related to hostage recovery was being passed on to the Israelis.These are not the only remote-controlled American military vehicles operating in the region.On Thursday, the US Navy announced that it had fired lethal munitions from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) - a speed boat - in the international waters of the Arabian Sea.In a statement, the Navy noted that the test on 23 October was the first time combat munitions had been fired from a USV in the Middle East.The US Navy said the development brings American military capabilities in the region to the \"next level\".Last month, the US Navy said it had shot down multiple drones and rockets fired from Yemen that were appearing to head towards Israel.The US has also sent two battleships to the eastern Mediterranean, saying that they are there to prevent the war between Hamas and Israel from spreading.In a fiery speech on Friday, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah warned the US against using the ships to attack the militant group.\"Your fleets in the Mediterranean do not scare us and will never scare us,\" said Hassan Nasrallah.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "Russell Brand has been accused of sexually assaulting an extra on a film set in a civil lawsuit filed in the US.During filming for the rom-com Arthur in July 2010 the comedian is alleged to have exposed himself to the anonymous woman before following her into a bathroom and sexually assaulting her.Brand is facing accusations of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse after reports in the British media.He denies the allegations and says his relationships were \"always consensual\".British police have said they are investigating a number of claims made against Brand, but the lawsuit, filed with New York State Supreme Court on Friday, marks the first time any such accusations have been levelled in a court.In an affidavit, the woman - referred to as Jane Doe - claims the actor had \"appeared intoxicated, smelled of alcohol, and was carrying a bottle of vodka on set\" before the assault on 7 July 2010.He then exposed himself to his accuser in full view of the cast and crew, the papers say.Later the same day the plaintiff says Brand entered the bathroom after her and assaulted her as \"a member of production crew guarded the door from outside\".Film studio Warner Bros Pictures and other companies involved in the production are also named as defendants.The woman says as a result of the alleged abuse she suffers from extreme embarrassment, shame and fear as well as finding it difficult to trust others.She says she has professional concerns about being named in association with the case as she still works as an actor and fears she could be \"blacklisted in the industry\".She is reported to be seeking unspecified damages from the British actor.The document says she was initially booked for three days but after the assault was not brought back for the following days and only paid for one.She also fears harassment from his followers should her identity be revealed, the papers say.The case has been filed under the Adult Survivor's Act, New York legislation which allows alleged victims of sexual offences for which the statute of limitations has passed to file civil suits for a one-year period between 24 November 2022 and 24 November 2023.Allegations from four women towards Brand were first made in a joint investigation by the Sunday Times, Times and Channel 4's Dispatches.They claimed the actor had sexually assaulted them in the UK and Los Angeles during a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, when he held high-profile jobs at BBC Radio 2, Channel 4 and as a Hollywood actor.Since then the Metropolitan Police said it was investigating allegations of sexual offences made following media reports about Brand, while Thames Valley Police is also looking into reports of harassment and stalking.A day before the media investigation into Brand was published online, the comedian shared a video on social media where he denied the allegations.In it, he denied \"serious criminal allegations\" he said were to be made against him, and said his relationships \"were absolutely, always consensual\".\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "More than 100 people have been killed after an earthquake struck remote western Nepal on Friday.Security forces have been deployed to help rescue efforts in the rugged districts of Jajarkot and West Rukum, 500km (310 miles) west of Kathmandu.Strong tremors were felt far away in the Nepalese capital and in cities in neighbouring India, including Delhi.The army spokesman said more than 100 people had been injured. Jajarkot's hospital is packed with the wounded.Three more tremors were felt within an hour of the quake, and many people have spent the rest of the night in the open because of fear of further quakes and damage to their houses.Video footage on local media showed crumbled facades of multi-storied brick houses. People were pictured digging through rubble in the dark to pull survivors from the remains of collapsed buildings in posts on social media.Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has reportedly left for the affected region. Posting on X, he expressed his \"deep sorrow\" at the loss of life and property wrought by the quake and said he had ordered security agencies to immediately launch rescue and relief operations.But those search and rescue operations are being hampered by roads becoming blocked by landslides that were triggered by the quake.The police chief of Jajarkot district Suresh Sunar told the Reuters news agency it was difficult to get a full picture of what had happened.\"I am out in the open myself. We are collecting details but due to cold and night it is difficult to get information from remote areas,\" Mr Sunar told Reuters.The earthquake was recorded at 23:47 local time (18:02 GMT), according to Nepal's Monitoring and Research Centre.The US Geological Survey measured the earthquake at a magnitude of 5.6, and said it was a shallow earthquake, meaning it happened closer to the earth's surface.Nepal is situated along the Himalayas, where there is a lot of seismic activity.Last month, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake was registered in the western district of Bajhang, resulting in injuries.In 2015, the country suffered two devastating earthquakes in which 9,000 people were killed and 22,309 injured.The first, on 25 April 2015, was a 7.8-magnitude quake which caused most of the damage and loss of life. A large number of aftershocks followed, including one that measured 7.3 in May of that year.The quakes destroyed or damaged more than 800,000 houses mainly in the western and central districts, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).Government buildings, some stretches of roads and Kathmandu Valley's famous historic monuments - Unesco world heritage sites - were destroyed or damaged with many villages north of Kathmandu flattened.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "Imagine you could go back in time 4.6 billion years and take a picture of our Sun just as it was being born. What would it look like?Well, you can get a clue from this glorious new image acquired by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).Towards the centre of this object, called HH212, is a star coming into existence that is probably no more than 50,000 years old.The scene would have looked much the same when our Sun was a similar age.You can't actually see the glow from the protostar itself because it's hidden within a dense, spinning disc of gas and dust.All you get are the pinky-red jets that it's shooting out in polar opposite directions.HH212 is sited in Orion, close to the three brilliant stars that make up the \"belt\" of the mythical hunter that gives the constellation its name. The distance from Earth is about 1,300 light-years.Physics suggests those dramatic outflows of gas are the means by which the nascent star regulates its birthing.\"As the blobby ball of gas at the centre compacts down, it rotates. But if it rotates too fast, it will fly apart, so something has to get rid of the angular momentum,\" explained Prof Mark McCaughrean.\"We think it's jets and outflows. We think that as all the material shrinks down, magnetic fields are pulled together and then some of the material coming in through the disc gets captured on magnetic fields and is thrown out through the poles. That's why we call these structures bi-polar,\" the European Space Agency senior scientific advisor told BBC News.The pinky-red colour denotes the presence of molecular hydrogen. That's two hydrogen atoms bonded together (rather like the \"HH\" in the protostar's name). Shockwaves are moving through the outflows, energising them and making them glow brightly in this Webb picture, which was captured predominantly at the infrared wavelength of 2.12 microns (that's the second part of the protostar's name!).The image of HH212 was acquired by JWST's Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam). You can't see the protostar itself because it's obscured by a dense, infalling disc of gas and dust. There are a few mature stars in the field of view, but most of the points of light are far-distant galaxies.In the annotated picture above, look closely at the left and right jets, and trace the knots of brightness in each of them. Count the bowshocks - where faster material has crashed into slower material just ahead of it.The structures are remarkably symmetric... except there appears to be an additional, albeit very messy bowshock on the right.In fact, there's probably a complementary bowshock on the other side. There are certainly pinky hints of it in a wider version of this Webb image. It's just that the density of gas and dust in space in that direction is thinner and so there's less material to excite and so the shock structure appears much more diffuse.Astronomers have been studying HH212 for 30 years, taking pictures every now and then to see how it's changed. As you might expect from the Webb super telescope, its new view is 10 times sharper than anything we've had before and will enable scientists to delve deeper into the processes that drive star formation.A nice feature is to run together the entire image history to make a movie, to see how elements in the jet structures change over time. Repeat observations mean you can also gauge the speed at which those elements are moving - at 100km per second and more.This video can not be playedWatch: See how the structure of HH212 has changed since being viewed in 2000I've kind of suggested the HH stands for molecular hydrogen, and it's a neat fit. But it really stands for Herbig-Haro, after George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, who did the pioneering work on this type of object in the 1940s and 50s.They would no doubt be amazed by the capabilities of JWST. It's not just the sharpness of image that Webb can achieve with its 6.5m primary mirror, it's also the breadth of colour its instruments can now detect that makes the telescope so special.\"As we said, the main wavelength for looking at these things - for looking at shocked molecular hydrogen - is 2.12 microns, or roughly four times longer than the mid-visible. But for the first time, we now have a good colour image of this particular object because we're able to observe it at other wavelengths that you just couldn't see from ground telescopes. And that will help us get into what's really happening in the jets,\" said Prof McCaughrean.Webb was intended to be transformative in many fields of astronomy, and the study of Herbig-Haro objects has definitely benefitted.Look below and you can marvel at HH212's cousin, called HH211. This object, located in the Perseus constellation, is even younger, again measured in mere thousands of years. To think our Sun started out like this.JWST is a joint venture between the US, European and Canadian space agencies.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "Three years ago on Sunday, the government brought in a second lockdown in England. People were told again to stay at home to protect the health service and save lives.Covid will, for some, feel like a distant memory. For others, it will bring back painful recollections of isolation and lost loved ones.Part of the Covid Inquiry's job is to find out how key decisions were made.The evidence we have seen at the hearings this week has been remarkable.Sitting in the press room at the inquiry in London - there was at times an overwhelming list of claims about what was going on at the heart of government, as we all grappled with the virus.To recap a few: \"Downing Street was in chaos\"; \"There was no plan for a Coronavirus response\", and \"It took too long for the first lockdown to be introduced\".Others include: Mr Johnson was \"weak and indecisive\" and \"often changed his mind\"; the prime minister apparently questioned shutting down the economy to save people who were going to \"die anyway\"; and \"Health Secretary Matt Hancock said things which turned out to be untrue\".The list goes on.It was claimed the atmosphere in No 10 was 'toxic and sexist'. Dominic Cummings, the PM's most powerful adviser, used the most vulgar language to refer to his colleagues and government ministers.This video can not be playedDominic Cummings on his 2020 messages about Downing Street's handling of Covid: \"My appalling language was obviously my own\"These are claims from key individuals. Some - like Mr Cummings - have made it clear how much they despise Mr Johnson. Others will give evidence before the end of the year and they may well have different recollections.But we are learning a lot about what Downing Street was like at the time in the eyes of people working there. And the picture isn't pretty.WhatsApp messages make it clear that the key players were bitterly divided and arguing with itself. Mr Cummings was scathing about some of the people who worked in Whitehall and furious about what was going on behind the scenes. Partly in response, senior civil servants were concerned that the environment was \"macho\" and \"sexist\". They were raising fears about a misogynist culture, and concerns that women were being ignored.That tells us about the culture in the most powerful building in the country. But it also paints a picture of senior advisers who didn't trust each other, didn't agree and sometimes didn't even talk - just as the biggest crisis in decades was unfolding. When the machinery of government needed to be pulling together to respond to Covid - it was perhaps as divided as it has ever been.What impact did that have?It's suggested that the macho culture led to overconfidence in the early stages of the pandemic - which senior civil servant Helen MacNamara describes as a \"de facto\" assumption that \"we were going to be great\".This video can not be playedA day after Dominic Cummings is challenged about some emails about a colleague in No 10 from 2020, she gives her reaction..She also argued forcefully that the interests of key groups like women, ethnic minorities and disadvantaged people were being ignored because they weren't represented in high-level discussions.None of this gives the impression of a government working effectively. But the problems appear to go deeper.Did the government have a proper plan for responding to the pandemic? We've known for a while that the UK's planning had been based on a flu-like viral outbreak, rather than other illnesses such as Covid.Different aides have said Mr Hancock insisted there was a plan. But many have also concluded that there wasn't. Ms MacNamara delivered a damning conclusion when she agreed that the former health secretary would often say things which turned out to be untrue. Mr Hancock will have his chance to defend himself against those claims in a few weeks.The actions of the prime minister were of course crucial too. We've heard multiple key aides claim Mr Johnson was indecisive, took too long to make decisions and often veered between very different positions.We've seen notes saying the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, believed Mr Johnson agreed with MPs who thought Covid was nature's way of dealing with older people.Sir Patrick, whose job it was to advise Johnson on matters of life and death, found him to be \"weak and indecisive\".Incredibly, Mr Cummings told the inquiry he didn't think it was worth including the prime minister in discussions about Covid in February 2020 - because he would just get in the way.For Mr Johnson's critics - this will confirm some of their worst fears; that he was the wrong man for the job. At the very least, it tells us that senior people around him had serious concerns.Mr Johnson will deliver his defence before Christmas. But we've seen snippets of his witness statement, in which he argues any responsible leader would debate the pros and cons of lockdown. \"We simply had no good choices, and it was necessary at all times to weigh up the harms that any choice would cause\", he argues.Stand back from it all a bit.We've heard some of these stories before. It's not a surprise that Mr Cummings didn't rate senior ministers and civil servants - he isn't shy about saying so. The divisions and tensions in No 10 were widely reported at the time. Many have consistently argued that Mr Johnson was the wrong man at the wrong time.But the stark picture painted at this week's hearings - of a dysfunctional, divided and chaotic No 10 - is a timely reminder of the events of 2020.The detailed and contemporaneous communications, foul-mouthed WhatsApp messages, diaries of concerned scientists and scribbled recordings of meetings involving cabinet ministers will bring back memories of those surreal, grim days of crisis - and help us discover a little more about what was going on in Downing Street.It may be the only time we see such unfiltered communications revealed in full - many in Westminster have turned on the \"disappearing messages\" function on WhatsApp in recent months.That doesn't mean there won't be a lot more to come before next year, however, with senior ministers getting set to give their version of events in the coming weeks.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "In a year of record-breaking achievements, Taylor Swift has done it again.A re-recording of her crossover pop album 1989 has become the UK's fastest-selling record of 2023.1989 (Taylor's Version) shifted 184,000 copies last week, more than double the opening-week sales of the 2014 original.It is the only album released this year to go gold in a single week, and is Swift's 11th UK number one overall.Among female artists, only Madonna has more chart toppers - and Swift is now within touching distance of her record of 12.1989 (Taylor's Version) was also the week's biggest-selling record on vinyl, with almost 62,000 copies sold.And three of the album's songs have debuted in the top 10 in the singles chart.All three are extra, previously-unreleased \"from the vault\" tracks, with Is It Over Now? claiming the number one position, followed by Now That We Don't Talk at number two, and the provocatively-titled Slut! at five.Swift has seen similar success in the US, where 1989 (Taylor's Version) has sold 1.1 million copies since its release last Friday.Of that sum, 580,000 were on vinyl - the largest week for a single album in that format since modern sales tracking began in 1991.Furthermore, 1989 (Taylor's Version) instantly became the year's biggest-selling album in the US, surpassing Swift's own 2022 release Midnights.The star now has the top three-selling albums of the year in her home country, with her re-recorded version of 2010's Speak Now in third position.The achievement justifies Swift's decision to re-record all of her first six albums.She started the project in 2021 after her old record label, Big Machine, sold her master tapes to music mogul Scooter Braun. He later sold them to an investment company.Rather than lose control of her recordings, the star decided to recreate them - and also refuses to licence the originals for use in TV and film shows, denying the new owners a lucrative revenue stream.Swift has also scored the biggest tour of 2023, with her Eras stadium shows bringing in $300m (\u00c2\u00a3242m) at the box office.Last week, the star was declared a billionaire by business publication Bloomberg, which estimated her net worth to be $1.1bn (\u00c2\u00a3907m).Only three other musicians have achieved billionaire status - Rihanna, Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 and Jay-Z. However, Swift is the first to reach the milestone based on music alone, as her rivals' fortunes incorporate business ventures in fashion, beauty products and hi-fi equipment.Swift's UK chart dominance could be briefly interrupted next week by the return of four musicians from Liverpool.The Beatles' \"last ever\" song, Now And Then, instantly became the UK's most-played song after its release on Thursday.On Spotify, the ballad racked up 386,752 streams on Spotify - overtaking Swift's Is It Over Now?, which was played 383,000 times.If the Fab Four can maintain that momentum over the next week, they could score their first UK number one single since The Ballad Of John And Yoko in 1969.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "This video can not be playedWatch: Video provided by activist Sayed Alwadaei shows his confrontation with Bob StewartA Conservative MP who told an activist to \"go back to Bahrain\" has been found guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence and fined \u00c2\u00a3600.Bob Stewart, MP for Beckenham in south-east London, got into a row with Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei outside the Foreign Office's Lancaster House in Westminster on 14 December.He told Mr Alwadaei: \"You're taking money off my country, go away.\"Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for him to lose the Tory whip.Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the 74-year-old had been attending an event hosted by the Bahraini Embassy when Mr Alwadaei, the director of advocacy at the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, shouted: \"Bob Stewart, for how much did you sell yourself to the Bahraini regime?\"Stewart replied: \"Go away, I hate you. You make a lot of fuss. Go back to Bahrain.\"Mr Alwadaei challenged Stewart on his connections with the country, asking repeatedly whether he had accepted any money from the Bahraini government.The MP, who was stationed in Bahrain as an Army officer in the 1960s, told the campaigner to \"get stuffed\" and added: \"Bahrain's a great place. End of.\"In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Alwadaei said: \"No-one should think twice about holding an MP or members of the government to account because of their skin colour.\"When I reported Mr Stewart to the Conservative Party, they didn't take action against him and when he was charged, they refused to suspend him.\"Given today's verdict, I expect them to take immediate action.\"Paul Jarvis, prosecuting, told the court: \"Mr Alwadaei felt upset and humiliated by what had taken place.\"He added: \"He (Stewart) demonstrated racial hostility towards Mr Alwadaei by way of his comments.\"However, the prosecutor said Stewart \"was not motivated by racial hostility\".Stewart's defence, Paul Cavin KC, had argued: \"There is no right to confront an MP in public and expect answers in a measured House of Commons way.\"He added: \"Any hostility was based on the complainant's behaviour, conduct and speech towards the defendant.\"Baroness Elizabeth Butler-Sloss, 90, giving character evidence, said \"kind\" and \"thoughtful\" Stewart has a \"flippant\" manner, adding: \"He is given to saying things that are unwise but his heart is absolutely in the right place.\"Asked for his thoughts on the allegations of racial hostility, Stewart said: \"That's absurd, it's totally unfair. My life has been, I don't want to say destroyed, but I am deeply hurt at having to appear in a court like this.\"I am not a racist. He was saying that I was corrupt and that I had taken money.\"My honour was at stake in front of a large number of ambassadors.\"Speaking after the guilty verdict, opposition parties, called for the Conservative whip to be removed from Mr Stewart, meaning he would need to sit as an independent MP.Labour chairwoman Anneliese Dodds said it was \"yet another serious Conservative scandal\".\"This behaviour is totally unacceptable for a sitting MP. Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party need to immediately take action, and remove the Conservative whip,\" she said.Liberal Democrat chief whip Wendy Chamberlain said: \"It's time Sunak finally acted with integrity. This should start with immediately removing the whip from Bob Stewart.\"Failing to remove the whip sends a dangerous message that behaviour like this is acceptable.\"The Conservative Party said it was not commenting at the moment.Parliamentary records show Stewart registered flights, accommodation and meals worth \u00c2\u00a35,349 during a four-day trip to Bahrain last November paid for by its ministry of foreign affairs.A separate entry covered by the Bahraini government shows another trip, worth \u00c2\u00a31,245.56, to visit an air show and meet its foreign minister.Mr Alwadaei alleged the country is \"corrupt\" and a \"human rights violator\".Claire Walsh, Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor of the CPS, said: \"His claim that his words were misinterpreted was rejected by the court in light of evidence presented by the CPS, including footage filmed by a witness and the victim's testimony.\"Hatred of any kind has no place in society and wherever our legal test is met, the CPS will not hesitate to prosecute those who perpetrate hate crimes.\"The MP was also ordered to pay legal costs of \u00c2\u00a3835.His \u00c2\u00a3600 fine would have been \u00c2\u00a3400 had it not been for the seriousness of the hate crime he committed, the CPS said.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "PM Rishi Sunak has said that planned protests on Armistice Day would be \"provocative and disrespectful\".There is a \"clear and present\" risk war memorials such as the Cenotaph in London could be \"desecrated\", he added.It comes as a pro-Palestinian march is planned in London on Saturday 11 November.Organisers said they had no plans to be near the Cenotaph and understand the sensitivity of the date.The Met Police said it was planning a \"significant\" operation and was in contact with organisers, who said they were \"willing to avoid the Whitehall area\", where the war memorial is located.Pro-Palestinian protests have been held in London, and other cities globally, each Saturday since the Israel-Gaza war began.Mr Sunak said on Friday: \"To plan protests on Armistice Day is provocative and disrespectful, and there is a clear and present risk that the Cenotaph and other war memorials could be desecrated, something that would be an affront to the British public and the values we stand for.\"He has also written a letter to Met Police chief Sir Mark Rowley, saying the force has the government's \"full support in making robust use of all your powers to protect Remembrance activity\". He added he was \"deeply concerned that a number of protests are currently planned to disrupt\" acts of remembrance.Sir Mark responded by saying police \"recognise the profound importance of remembrance events\" and are committed to ensuring they \"take place without disruption\".Mr Sunak has asked the Home Secretary Suella Braverman to support the police in \"doing everything necessary to protect the sanctity of Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday\".Ms Braverman said there was an \"obvious risk of serious public disorder, violence and damage\" if a protest on 11 November goes ahead, describing it as a \"hate march through London\".Several events to mark the end of World War One are typically held across the UK on Armistice Day, which is always on 11 November.This year these include a two-minute silence commemorating the war dead, and the daytime and evening Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall in London, with the latter performance usually attended by members of the Royal Family.On Remembrance Sunday, which this year falls on 12 November, thousands of servicemen and women usually march past the Cenotaph war memorial in central London, where military veterans are joined by senior politicians and members of the Royal Family.The 11 November protest is expected to call for a ceasefire on the Gaza Strip.Organisers said they were aware of the importance of the date, and their previous demonstrations had been peaceful and orderly.Ben Jamal, director of Palestine Solidarity Campaign, said it had \"made clear that we have no intention of marching anywhere near Whitehall out of respect for events taking place at the Cenotaph\".He added the march will begin almost two hours after the silence of commemoration for the war dead.\"Each of the protests we have called have been peaceful, orderly, and attended by hundreds of thousands of demonstrators from a diverse cross section of British society,\" he said, adding that \"to suggest that undertaking protests well away from Whitehall is a disrespect for the war dead is an insult to those marching for peace\".Ismail Patel, spokesman for Friends of Al-Aqsa, a pro-Palestinian non-governmental organisation, said: \"We definitely will not be at the Cenotaph. We understand the sensitivity of the date.\"Responding to Mr Sunak's comment about \"disrespectful\" protests, Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of the international campaign group Human Rights Watch, called it \"cynical, culture war politics and an attack on our democratic freedoms\".The Met said a \"significant policing and security operation\" would be conducted on 11 and 12 November, and that it was \"absolutely committed to ensuring the safety and security of anyone attending commemorative events\".\"We will use all the powers available to us to ensure anyone intent on disrupting it will not succeed,\" a spokesperson said.They added that the police were aware of a \"significant demonstration\" planned for 11 November, but not Remembrance Sunday, and that organisers were \"engaging with our officers and have said they are willing to avoid the Whitehall area, recognising the sensitivities around the date\".Writing in the Times on Saturday,Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis said the lines between those who wish only to advocate for the welfare of innocent Palestinians and those who support Hamas have become badly blurred.\"Those lines have remained blurred in the subsequent demonstrations, in which a minority have proudly displayed their extremism on their banners and in their chants, while the majority stand alongside them,\" he said.On Friday, five people were arrested during a pro-Palestinian sit-in at London's King's Cross station after the demonstration was banned. Transport Secretary Mark Harper said he had given an order to allow police to stop the protest.Israel has been bombarding Gaza with prolonged air strikes following the 7 October attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, in which they killed 1,400 people and took more than 200 hostage.The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israeli air strikes have killed more than 9,000 people.Protests in London have been largely peaceful, although there have been 99 arrests of people who attended the three massive weekly marches in London. BBC reporters who have witnessed the demonstrations have seen a wide range of people from different backgrounds attending, including lots of families with children.On Friday, two women were charged with a terror offence after allegedly carrying \"an image displaying a paraglider\" at a pro-Palestinian protest in London, and police are still looking for a third woman.Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said it was \"incredibly important\" that demonstrators understood the importance of Remembrance events, telling PA News: \"I'd encourage the organisers to work with the police to stay away from the Cenotaph.\"It comes as Met commissioner Sir Mark told the London Assembly that he was \"deeply concerned\" about the impact on community policing after 3,500 officers were redeployed to central London protests in the past three weeks.Campaign Against Antisemitism has also written an open letter to Sir Mark, after he said hate crime laws \"probably need redrawing\" as he faced questions about the policing of pro-Palestinian marches.The letter, signed by lawyers, said it is \"quite clearly the case that there are existing laws that are simply not being applied or enforced with sufficient rigour\" by the Met.Ahead of planned protests this coming weekend, the Met says there will be a \"sharper focus\" on potential criminal behaviour, and will be using facial recognition technology to identify known suspects, including potential terrorists.Scotland Yard also said that since 1 October it has received 554 crime reports of antisemitic incidents - in the same period last year the police investigated 44 such reports.The number of reported Islamophobic hate crimes for the same period has reached 220 - up from 70 during the same period last year.So far 133 people have been arrested. Of those, 26 have so far been charged - 14 in relation to alleged antisemitism and six for alleged Islamophobia.Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A former US state department official has been sentenced to nearly six years in prison for his role in the US Capitol riot.Federico Klein, 45, was convicted in July on 12 charges, including assaulting officers and obstructing an official proceeding.Prosecutors said Klein was in the first wave of rioters to enter a Capitol tunnel on 6 January 2021.\"You can't stop this!\" he said, wedging open doors with a stolen police shield.The former Marine spent more than an hour pushing against the line of officers and encouraged others to attack police, according to evidence at trial.At the time, Klein was working as a South America specialist at the state department, a post he was appointed to by the Trump administration in 2017.He resigned from the job on 19 Jan 2021, one day before President Joe Biden was inaugurated.Previously, Klein worked for Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.He was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison on Friday.US District Judge Trevor McFadden told Klein his actions were \"shocking and egregious\".Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 10 years.But in a pre-sentencing memo, Klein's lawyers argued that the government was exaggerating his role in the riot.They said he \"should be sentenced for his actual role in the events of the day, and not the more egregious conduct of others\".The defence team had asked for a sentence of 40 days in prison followed by probation.More than 1,100 people have been charged in connection with the riot.This video can not be played'I'm ashamed my father was a Capitol Hill rioter'\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "A foundation has been set up in the name of late actor Matthew Perry to help those struggling with addiction.Perry, who was best known for playing Chandler in TV sitcom Friends, died on Saturday at the age of 54.The star battled addictions to alcohol and drugs for much of his life.A statement from the Matthew Perry Foundation said it was \"the realization of Matthew's enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction\".It added: \"In the spirit of Matthew Perry's enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction, we embark on a journey to honor his legacy by establishing the Matthew Perry Foundation, guided by his own words and experiences, and driven by his passion for making a difference in as many lives as possible.\"The foundation's website also features one of Perry's quotes, which has been widely circulated since his death.\"When I die, I don't want Friends to be the first thing that's mentioned,\" he said last year. \"I want helping others to be the first thing that's mentioned. And I'm going to live the rest of my life proving that.\"It also has another quote from his 2022 memoir: \"Addiction is far too powerful for anyone to defeat alone. But together, one day at a time, we can beat it down.\"A spokesman for the National Philanthropic Trust, which provides frameworks to help not-for-profit organisations raise money, confirmed it was managing the new fund.Perry was found dead in a hot tub in his Los Angeles home. A post mortem examination was inconclusive and officials are awaiting the results of toxicology tests.Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman said she spoke to him two weeks ago and he was \"in a really good place, which is why this seems so unfair\".She told NBC's Today show: \"He wanted to help other addicts and it gave him purpose.\"Friends co-creator David Crane agreed that helping other addicts \"absolutely became his purpose, his reason for being\".Perry turned his $10m Malibu beach compound into Perry House, a men's sober living facility, in 2012, and the project received an award from the White House the following year.He sold it two years later but said he was still committed to providing services for recovering addicts.Others paying tribute in recent days have included fellow actor Hank Azaria, who said Perry had been like a \"brother\" and helped him stop drinking.In a video posted on Instagram, he said: \"The night I went into AA, Matthew brought me in.\"The whole first year I was sober, we went to meetings together and he was such a great... I got to tell him this. As a sober person he was so caring and giving and wise and he totally helped me get sober.\"In a joint statement released on Monday, Perry's five Friends co-stars said they were \"all so utterly devastated\" by the news of his death.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "One of the first things to understand about the reportage, analysis and commentary that has poured out since the Hamas attacks of 7 October is that no-one has the full story. Not only is it, as ever, hard to penetrate the fog of war to work out what is happening on the battlefield. The new shape of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians has not yet emerged.Events are still moving fast. Fears that the war could spread are very real. New realities in the Middle East are out there somewhere, but their shape and the way that they will work depend on the way this war goes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond.Here are a few things that we know, and a few that we do not. The list is not exhaustive. Some people mocked Donald Rumsfeld, US defence secretary at the time of the invasion of Iraq in 2003, when he talked of \"unknown unknowns\". But in this part of the world as much as any other, they exist - and when they emerge, they can make a big difference.One certainty is that Israelis support the military campaign to break the power in Gaza of Hamas and its junior partner, Islamic Jihad. Their anger is driven by the shock of the Hamas attacks, the killing of more than 1,400 people and the fact that around 240 hostages are still being held in Gaza.I met Noam Tibon, a retired general in the Israeli army, to hear about how he drove down with his wife to Nahal Oz, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza, after Hamas attacked on 7 October. His mission, which was successful, was to rescue his son, his daughter in law and their two young daughters who were in their safe room, hearing Hamas gunmen roaming around outside.Tibon may be retired but he is a very fit-looking 62-year-old. He ended up armed with an assault rifle and a helmet he had taken from a dead Israeli soldier, leading a group of soldiers he had assembled in the chaos of that day, clearing the kibbutz and saving the lives of his family and many others.The general was an old-school, straight-talking Israeli officer.\"Gaza is going to suffer\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 no nation will agree that your neighbour will slaughter babies, women or people. Just like you (Britons) crushed your enemy during World War Two. This is what we need to do in Gaza. No mercy.\"What, I asked, about innocent Palestinian civilians who are getting killed?\"Unfortunately, it's happening. We live in a tough neighbourhood, and we need to survive\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 we have to be tough. We have no choice.\"A lot of Israelis are echoing his sentiment that Palestinian civilian deaths are unfortunate, but they are being killed because of the actions of Hamas.It is also clear that Israel's assault on Hamas is causing terrible bloodshed. The latest figure for Palestinian deaths from Gaza's health ministry, run by Hamas, has exceeded 9,000 - of whom around 65% are children and women.It is not clear how many of the men who have been killed were civilians or fighting for Hamas or Islamic Jihad. US President Joe Biden and the Israelis do not trust the ministry figures. But in past conflicts, Palestinian casualty statistics have been considered accurate by international organisations.One grim milestone is fast approaching. The United Nations (UN) says around 9,700 civilians have been killed in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion 21 months ago.Some of the Palestinian dead would have been part of Hamas. But even if that proportion is as high as 10%, which is unlikely, it means that Israel is on course to have killed as many Palestinian civilians in just over a month as Russia has killed in Ukraine since February 2022. (The UN says its data for Ukraine is incomplete and the true number of civilians killed is likely higher, while in Gaza the number of dead is also likely to be higher as many Palestinians are believed to be buried under rubble).The UN human rights office has said that so many civilians have been killed and wounded in Israeli air strikes that it has serious concerns that the attacks are disproportionate and could be war crimes.From the first days after the Hamas attacks, President Biden has supported Israel's decision to use military force to remove Hamas from power. But he has also added the qualification that it needed to be done \"the right way\". He meant that Israel should observe the laws of war that protect civilians.The US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has arrived in Tel Aviv. Before he took off, he said: \"When I see a Palestinian child - a boy, a girl - pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building, that hits me in the gut as much as seeing a child from Israel or anywhere else.\"I have reported on all of Israel's wars in the last 30 years. I do not remember a US administration stating so publicly that Israel needs to observe the laws of war. Blinken's visit suggests that he believes Israel is not following Biden's advice.Something else we know for certain is that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under great pressure.Unlike Israel's security and military chiefs, he has not accepted any personal responsibility for the catastrophic series of failures that left Israeli border communities virtually undefended on 7 October.Last Sunday, 29 October, he caused uproar when he sent out a tweet blaming the intelligence agencies. Mr Netanyahu deleted the message and apologised.Three Israelis, a former peace negotiator, the ex-head of the Shin Bet (Israel's internal intelligence agency) and a tech entrepreneur, wrote an article in the journal Foreign Affairs saying that Mr Netanyahu should not have any part of the war and whatever follows. The Israeli PM has loyal supporters, but he has lost the confidence of prominent figures in Israel's military and security establishment.Noam Tibon, the retired general who fought his way into kibbutz Nahal Oz to rescue his family, compares Mr Netanyahu to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister who was forced to resign in 1940, and replaced by Winston Churchill.Tibon told me: \"This is the biggest failure in the history of the state of Israel. It was a military failure. It was an intelligence failure. And it was the failure of the government\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the one really in charge - and all the blame is on him - is the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 He is in charge of the biggest failure in the history of Israel.\"It is also clear that the old status quo has been smashed. It was unpleasant and dangerous, but it seemed to have a certain grimly-familiar stability. Since the end of the last Palestinian uprising around 2005 a pattern has emerged that Mr Netanyahu believed could be sustained indefinitely. That was a dangerous illusion, for all concerned - Palestinians as well as Israelis.The argument went that the Palestinians were no longer a threat to Israel. Instead, they were a problem to be managed. The tools available include sticks, carrots and the ancient tactic of \"divide and rule\".Mr Netanyahu, who has been prime minister for most of the time since 2009 - after an earlier spell between 1996 and 1999 - has argued consistently that Israel does not have a partner for peace.Potentially, it did. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which is the main rival to Hamas, is a deeply flawed organisation, and many who support it believe its aged President Mahmoud Abbas needs to step aside. But it accepted the idea of establishing a Palestinian state alongside Israel back in the 1990s.\"Divide and rule\" for Mr Netanyahu meant allowing Hamas to build its power in Gaza at the expense of the PA.While Israel's longest-serving prime minister is always careful about what he says in public, his actions over many years show that he does not want to allow the Palestinians to have an independent state. That would involve giving up land in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which the Israeli right wing believes belongs to the Jews.From time to time, Mr Netanyahu's pronouncements would leak. In 2019, a number of Israeli sources say that he told a group of his Likud members of parliament that if they opposed a Palestinian state they should support schemes to pump money - mostly provided by Qatar - into Gaza. He told them that deepening the division between Hamas in Gaza and the PA in the West Bank would make it impossible to establish a state.It is also clear that Israel, backed by the Americans, will not tolerate a deal that allows Hamas to stay in power. That guarantees a lot more bloodshed. It also raises big questions about what or who replaces them, which so far have not been answered.The conflict between Arabs and Jews for control of the land between the river Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea has lasted for more than 100 years. One lesson of its long and bloody history is that there will never be a military solution.In the 1990s, the Oslo peace process was established to try to end the conflict by establishing a Palestinian state with a capital in East Jerusalem alongside Israel. The last attempt to revive it, after years of on-off negotiations, happened during the Obama administration. It failed a decade ago, and since then the conflict has been allowed to fester.As President Biden and many others have said, the only possible chance for avoiding more wars is to establish a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That will not be possible with the current leaders on either side. Extremists, both Israeli and Palestinian, would do all they could to scupper the idea, as they have done since the 1990s. Some of them believe they are following the will of God, which makes it impossible to persuade them to accept a secular compromise.But if this war does not deliver enough of a shock to break deeply-held prejudices and to make the idea of two states viable, nothing will. And without a mutually-acceptable way of ending the conflict, more generations of Palestinians and Israelis will be sentenced to more wars.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "In November 2019, the BBC reported on Shams Erfan, a 21-year-old Afghan who fled the Taliban, alone, as a teenager. We met him in Indonesia, where he was stuck in a refugee camp - one of millions worldwide with only a tiny chance of starting a new life. Four years later, he writes his own story.On the afternoon of 8 November 2021, I sat on the cement stairs inside the International Ferry Terminal in the city of Batam, Indonesia. It was a three-minute walk from the refugee shelter where I lived; an escape from the camp's small, dark and windowless rooms.Two cargo ships were parked on the other side of the terminal promenade. I watched the men unloading sacks of rice and flour from the ship. The warm salty water, breaking against the cement wall of the promenade, splashed on my face.With nowhere to go, I found another bench, at the east end of the terminal, under the shade of a coconut tree. I could see the ferries full of tourists leaving Batam for Singapore, just across the water. I became lost in imagination, dreaming of freedom.Soon, I had to return to the shelter's small, cramped rooms, to meet the 6pm curfew. To distract myself, I opened my phone. There was an email.It was from the International Organization for Migration (IOM).I had been in Indonesia since fleeing Afghanistan in December 2014, aged 15. Back then, on a trip to Kabul to pick up supplies for the English-language school where I worked, Taliban gunmen hijacked my bus, looking to kill the \"English teacher\".As the gunmen slapped my face, a stranger saved my life. But even then, I knew: I had to leave Afghanistan. I fled to Delhi, then Kuala Lumpur, before taking a wooden boat across the Strait of Malacca. After bouncing around various sites in Indonesia, in 2016 I found myself in Pontianak, a prison camp for asylum seekers.Resettlement rates from Indonesia to third countries, via the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR), were low. The chances of receiving an individual resettlement offer were almost non-existent. Certainty seemed elusive.In prison, I wrote a blog about the living conditions of refugees, like me, who were trapped. My audience was small but supportive. One evening in 2018, as the last rays of the sun disappeared behind the razor wire-topped walls, and a dark, unwelcome cloud obscured the blue skies, I got a message from Canada.It was from Renee Oettershagen, a lady from Burlington, Ontario. Renee had read my work and we had become friends. I connected her with friends in Australia - Denise, Lindy, Diana, and Jane - who were also eager to help me escape Indonesia. They had read my work and wanted me to live somewhere as a normal citizen, with full rights, rather than the in-limbo, locked-up life of an asylum seeker.Our team discovered that I was eligible to apply for permanent residency in Canada through the Group of Five programme. Under this programme, groups of Canadians living in one community could form a group to sponsor a refugee, so long as they were already recognised by the UNHCR, which I was.To begin the paperwork, we needed 16,500 Canadian dollars (\u00c2\u00a39,825) held in a bank account, allocated for my first year's living expenses in Canada. It was a daunting sum, and raising it seemed impossible.That evening, as I walked in circles on the prison's dirt ground, Renee messaged me with incredible news. She and her husband, Bill, had agreed to welcome me into one of their empty bedrooms in their house.As I burst into laughter, amazed that these Australians and Canadians had opened their hearts and homes, the security guard yelled at me to return to my cell.Despite the guard's anger, half my problem was resolved - we now only needed 8,000 CAD. The other half of the funds was raised between my Australian friends, and we needed three more Canadians to join the team the Group of Five.Another woman, Wendy Noury Long, became aware of my story. She joined the team with her husband and son, and we submitted my application to the government of Canada in January 2020.Almost two years later, I sat at the Batam ferry terminal and read the email from the IOM.\"We have scheduled your flight to move to Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, to complete your medical examination and biometric process at the Canadian embassy, in order to leave Indonesia for Canada.\"In order to leave Indonesia for Canada.I read the email five times. Maybe he sent it by mistake? I washed my face in the terminal's bathroom with cold water, then took a long, deep breath.I turned on my internet and read the email again. It was for me. I saw my name. It was real.I'm leaving. My application for permanent residency in Canada was accepted.The news flowed through my veins like a morning breeze, propelling my body to run towards the shelter to meet the curfew. Arriving five minutes late would mean being sent to solitary confinement.A local man, who had a few packs of instant coffee and noodles on his cart, was sitting on a portable red plastic chair outside the terminal gate. He had taken off his shirt and was using it to dry the sweat dripping from his forehead.As I walked past, he called me \"Orang Migran\" - a refugee man. The words echoed in my ears, like congratulations for surviving eight years of life in detention. I felt lighter. The trees lined up on both side of the roads, gently rustling, celebrating the news with me.The next day, I went to Jakarta. I completed my medical examination at a hospital, and two months later, completed my biometrics at the Canadian embassy.It still felt surreal. While in the embassy, I could almost smell Canada.My flight to Canada was scheduled for 3 March 2022. As the IOM dropped me off at the airport in Jakarta, I couldn't believe I was there, waiting for my flight to take off.In my hand, I held the travel document and ticket issued by the Canadian government. I kept looking at them, doubting their authenticity. At the same time, my eyes continued to scan every corner of the waiting room, looking for immigration officers who might order me back to the refugee shelter.Finally, the call for the flight came. Unlike the camps, there was no immigration officer to accompany me. When I needed to use the restroom, I went alone. When I wanted a cup of tea, the number wasn't monitored.We finally landed at Istanbul Airport where I waited, tired and red-eyed, for the connecting flight to Canada. But I couldn't sleep.The night before, the IOM said they would pick me up at midday. I couldn't settle, fearing the immigration guards would find an excuse to cancel my flight if I were late.Now - despite being awake for 30 hours - I still couldn't risk napping on the bench and missing my flight to Canada. So I stayed awake, my dry eyes blinking, my excitement rising.Finally, I boarded the plane. The screen on the back of the seat showed our location. As the plane flew over Europe and got farther away from Indonesia, my dream of seeing something - anything - outside Indonesia since 2014 was coming true.As the plane began its descent, almost everyone seemed calm, their expressions revealing no sign of excitement or happiness. I was different.The snowy landscape of Toronto came into view. My heart beat faster. Finally, it was my turn to disembark. The passengers walking alongside me to the terminal blew on their hands to keep them warm. The mother who sat next to me on the plane took off her jacket and wrapped it around her child's body.My coat, which was considered warm in Indonesia, did nothing to keep out the cold. But right then, I didn't notice it. The excitement of arriving in Canada overcame any of that.Walking toward the airport terminal, I realised, again, there were no guards accompanying me. In the past eight years in Indonesia, every time I was transferred from one detention centre to another, there were always at least 10 guards monitoring my every move. Now I was free.I walked alone through the airport gate to meet my sponsors, who were holding a sign that read: \"Welcome Shams\".Outside it was still cold, but the welcome made my body glow. My sponsors had only met me online. To them, I was a stranger.During my eight-year imprisonment in Indonesian prison camps, I blogged anonymously about the refugees' living conditions, hoping to bring our plight to the world's attention. To be safe, I had to use a pen name.But that night, everyone called me by my own name. I was no longer invisible. I was no longer a label; an \"illegal\"; a number. I'd escaped the Taliban's attempt to kill me, only to endure eight years imprisonment in Indonesia. At last, thanks to my sponsors and their friends, I was free.Shams Erfan, 25, is a permanent resident in Canada and will take the Canadian citizenship test in 18 months' time. He is a writer-in-residence at the George Brown College in Toronto and studies at the University of Toronto, with plans to become a human rights and immigration lawyer.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "Just the mere mention of bed bugs can make your your skin crawl.Panic over the pesky pests has swept across Europe over the past couple of months, following reports of soaring infestations.Although their bites can cause itchiness, bedbugs do not usually cause other physical health problems in humans.However, it is the effect on one's mental health that can be most damaging - leaving some who have had infestations with anxiety, flashbacks and insomnia.Why do some of us itch when we're just thinking and reading about bed bugs- even if we've never had an infestation?It's all to do with the mind-body connection, says Dr Heather Sequeira, a clinical psychologist who specialises in anxiety and obsessional behaviours.\"Our brain has this remarkable ability to make associations between specific thoughts or mental images and physical sensations,\" she says.\"When you think about bedbugs, your brain may activate memories or mental images associated with the discomfort of getting bitten by an insect and initiate neural patterns associated with heightened awareness, leading to increased skin sensations.\"Psychogenic itching - how psychologists describe an itch which has no dermatological or systemic cause - is a very common phenomenon.But, Dr Sequeira says, the more you fear or feel disgusted by bedbugs, the more likely you are to experience it.\"By saying we all have psychogenic itching to some degree, we normalise it,\" she adds.\"If we are scared, anxious, or grossed out by something, our body goes on high alert to detect that potential 'threat'.\"Similarly, if we are experiencing anxiety and stress for different reasons, we are also more likely to have a stronger reaction to thinking about bedbugs\".Dr Sequeira says she has had more patients telling her about their bedbug-related anxieties over the past couple of months - which she attributes in part to \"heightened awareness\" resulting from the increased media coverage.There have been recent reported infestations in Paris and other French cities, and a library in west London closed temporarily after the insects were discovered in the furnishings.Dr Angharad Rudkin, a clinical psychologist who specialises in anxiety and intrusive thoughts, says for people whose \"threat alert system\" is already high, reading about recent outbreaks confirms in their minds that it could soon become a reality for them too.\"[They think] 'It has happened in Paris and it could happen to me',\" she says.Dr Rudkin also says the experience is very normal but is worse for people who have anxiety disorders.\"All of us are getting that slightly itchy feeling,\" she says.\"Depending on your mental health, if you are feeling quite relaxed it will not be more than a passing thought, but if catches you when you are stressed or tired it can get a bit stickier.\"The problem can be compounded at the thought of your bedroom no longer being a place of safety.\"Finding a spider in your bed is far worse than finding it in a bathroom,\" Dr Rudkin says.One school of thought which explains why some of us react in this way is our survival instincts, Dr Rudkin explains.\"The people who were a little bit on edge and had their threat alert on high were the ones who survived,\" she says.\"We are the descendants of worriers, so our bodies are wired to respond in this way.\"Dr Abigael San, who specialises in cognitive therapy, says the itching sensation is about imagery.\"When the image of something is really meaningful for you, especially if it carries threatening information, your brain is doing the same thing as if it was really there,\" she says.\"It's not just bedbugs, looking at a spider will give you that sensation of feeling like a spider is crawling on you - you know it's not there but the sensation is there.\"For a lot of people who are scared of bugs, just conjuring up an image can feel really, really scary.\"The part of your brain dealing with fear and threat will light up in the same way as if the physical thing was in front of you.\"Dr San has worked with a patient who she says was \"traumatised\" by her experience with bedbugs.\"She was not someone who had a fear of bugs before, for her it was the trauma that it carried,\" she says.\"The trauma was about other stuff - the pest control person, her feeling blamed.\"For her, looking at an image of bedbugs will provoke feelings of anger and shame.\"\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Dr. Abigael San, a cognitive therapist, explains that the itching sensation some people experience when looking at images of bedbugs is due to the imagery being meaningful and carrying threatening information.

    "For many of those who go to London's new 15,000-capacity superclub Drumsheds, it won't be the first time they've stepped inside the huge building.That's because the Tottenham warehouse used to house Ikea's UK flagship store.The Swedish furniture-maker closed this branch in 2022, leaving behind a 608,000 sq ft (56,485m sq) space.Now, its familiar aisles and showrooms have been replaced by panoramic screens, high-quality sound systems and immersive light displays in three rooms that can accommodate all types of dance music.As you walk in for the first time, it's hard to wipe memories of what the space used to look like - the main entrance hall has been created from the space that used to house Ikea's bits and bobs like crockery and bedding.It's somewhere I've marked a few milestones, including the big trolley dash before moving to university to get kitchen essentials, and again a couple of years ago when I moved into my own place for the very first time.Others shares the same thoughts - a woman in front of me marvels at how the old caf\u00c3\u00a9 has been turned into a huge bar, serving beers and cocktails rather than meatballs and hot dogs.For this particular event, the venue has been decked out by Spanish electronic dance company Elrow for Halloween.The main 9,000-capacity room - which used to be the superstore's flat pack warehouse - is decorated with pumpkins, ghouls and every other spooky stereotype.Hosting so many people in one space was never going to be without problems. A one-way system put in to help people get in and out of rooms was described to me as \"very annoying\" and \"pretty confusing\" by friends Jay and Cameron, who I met in a long, static queue for the smallest, 1,000-capacity room.It's also been pouring with rain all day and nowhere outside is covered - something Harry describes as \"not good\" as his chips turn soggy during the downpour.This seems a bit of an oversight considering the club operates a lot of day parties and isn't open in the summer months so it doesn't compete with festival season.Rach, who is in the drop-off area trying to order a cab, says on first impressions \"it definitely brought back some memories of visiting Ikea\".\"I loved that each room had a completely different feel,\" she adds. \"It could take a little while to get into each of the rooms because of the layout but crowds moved quickly.\"The sound system was super clear, especially in the smaller rooms and the bars were easily accessible from each room.\"Visiting a new clubbing space doesn't happen often in this current climate. UK nightlife has been in decline for 15 years and this week, for the first time since records began 30 years ago, the number of venues serving alcohol dropped below 100,000.Like with most venues in their opening weeks, there are teething problems. But Drumsheds doesn't feel too big to succeed - having space to move on the dancefloor is welcome in a post-pandemic world where we're all a little less comfortable with being crammed in to tight spaces.It also fills a gap left by the closure of operator Broadwick Live's previous venue - Printworks - by recreating an industrial, warehouse environment and filling it with the biggest names in dance music.Much like Printworks, an old printing press that closed earlier this year to make room for a new office development, Drumsheds only has temporary planning permission and could make way for housing or office space in the next few years.Broadwick co-founder Simeon Aldred told the BBC earlier this year that night-time spaces were under huge threat in urban areas, with his company facing \"massive challenges\".\"One of the things post-pandemic is that people have been living in silence, local communities have become very quiet places,\" he said.\"So around licensing and planning, there's challenges and inconsistencies - you've got some councils that are really pro-culture and some that are less so.\"After the pandemic, there's also a concern that business rates could increase significantly in 2024 if inflation fails to fall. That, coupled with an end to government relief scheme, could mean more closures across the hospitality industry.Aldred said Broadwick's operating costs across its 26 UK venues \"have gone up by millions\" and that trying to keep a hospitality company going amid the numerous challenges \"has been really, really difficult\".The creation of Drumsheds was facilitated by Amy Lam\u00c3\u00a9, who has been night czar to the mayor of London since 2016.She tells the BBC it is already \"proving a real boost to our city\".\"Our world-renowned nightlife is integral to our economic and social recovery and Drumsheds is a great example of how we can repurpose spaces to bring people together,\" she says.\"I am proud to have supported the venue and will continue to do all I can to champion and support the industry as we build a better London for all.\"Whether or not Drumsheds gets the chance to establish itself as a night time destination, for now it provides a haven for those who want to spend their weekends on the dancefloor rather than shopping in a Swedish superstore.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "The average full-time worker in the UK was earning nearly \u00c2\u00a335,000 a year in April, official data shows, a rise of 5.8% on the previous year.The size of that rise varies from job to job, with travel agents getting a pay bump of 21%, while sport coaches saw their earnings fall the most.Despite the increases in pay, most workers' wages rose by less than inflation, the rate at which the cost of goods and services rise.This means that in real terms, wages fell by 1.9% for full-time workers - a sign of the continued cost of living squeeze.Use the lookup table below to see what the average pay is in your job group, how that has changed from the previous year, and whether a pay rise has topped inflation.The salary data in the table above comes from the latest Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings release from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which covers the year to April 2023.These are not the most up-to-date figures on the job market, but they provide a more granular view than the monthly labour statistics published by the ONS.In this analysis, we used the gross annual pay for full-time workers for each occupation group. We're showing you the median wages, which is how much the middle-ranking employee earns.To calculate the annual change in real terms, we adjusted April 2022 earnings to what they would have been in April 2023 if workers received pay rises in line with inflation, or more precisely, the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH). The difference between the recorded April 2023 wages and the inflation-adjusted estimates is the annual change in real terms.For the job group titles, we used the latest ONS classification of occupations, which groups related jobs together.

    "The risks from artificial intelligence (AI) are unknown even to GCHQ, its director has told the BBC.In her first interview since taking over the UK's largest intelligence agency, Anne Keast-Butler said AI could amplify existing threats and create new risks.She said the uncertain nature of the risks made international collaboration vital.Ms Keast-Butler was speaking after attending the UK's first AI summit.The two-day gathering on artificial intelligence safety was held at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire, home to Britain's code-breakers during World War II.While war-time Bletchley's work was secret, its modern-day successor, GCHQ, now operates at least partly in the public eye with the intelligence agency's new director mingling with tech heads and foreign officials, including from China, at this week's summit.And AI brought two main concerns, Anne Keast-Butler told the BBC in an exclusive interview. One was the way it will amplify existing problems.\"Bad people will always want to use the latest technology,\" she said, pointing to the way in which AI is already being used to generate images of child-abuse and make it easier to carry out cyber-attacks and steal data.But the other concern was uncertainty.\"There are lots of different views out there on artificial intelligence and whether it is going to end the world or be the best opportunity ever. And the truth is none of us really know,\" she told the BBC.Even with all the insight and technology available to GCHQ, she said it was impossible to be sure of the outcomes. \"My experience is when you don't know, you should plan for the worst. That way the outcomes are only better.\"She said that meant ensuring the next generation of AI was built with safety and security in mind - including clear guardrails and testing before products were unleashed into the wild.Ensuring this was done by countries and companies working together was crucial, she said. \"There was real common consensus on doing that and doing it together,\" she added of the discussions at the summit.Overall though, she said she remains positive about artificial intelligence.\"I'm an AI optimist. As the head of GCHQ, I see how technology has really helped us get better and better at our job,\" she said.GCHQ collects and analyses global communications. Much of this is digital, as opposed to the radio signals from Bletchley days.It has long used forms of what is now called AI for the translation of intercepted communications. But GCHQ is also now trying to use AI to analyse the emotion and meaning of the vast amounts of material it collects, in order to help human analysts and linguists zero in on the material of greatest interest.Keast-Butler, who spent most of her career in MI5, took over as 17th director of GCHQ in May 2023 and as the first woman in the role.\"It's a bit surprising to be in 2023 and discover that you can be the first woman to do anything,\" she said, adding that back in wartime Bletchley, 75% of the work-force were women.But she added that in the years between, there had been a problem with the lack of women working in technology.Wartime Bletchley, she said, was about bringing together technology and people in order to crack what seemed like insolvable problems - and that remained the priority today even in a very different world.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "Russell Brand has been accused of sexually assaulting an extra on a film set in a civil lawsuit filed in the US.During filming for the rom-com Arthur in July 2010 the comedian is alleged to have exposed himself to the anonymous woman before following her into a bathroom and sexually assaulting her.Brand is facing accusations of rape, sexual assaults and emotional abuse after reports in the British media.He denies the allegations and says his relationships were \"always consensual\".Brand has yet to respond to the lawsuit.British police have said they are investigating a number of claims made against Brand, but the case, filed with New York State Supreme Court on Friday, marks the first time any such accusations have been made in a lawsuit.In an affidavit, the woman - referred to as Jane Doe - claims the actor had \"appeared intoxicated, smelled of alcohol, and was carrying a bottle of vodka on set\" before the assault on 7 July 2010.He then exposed himself to his accuser in full view of the cast and crew, the papers say.Later the same day the plaintiff says Brand entered the bathroom after her and assaulted her as \"a member of production crew guarded the door from outside\".Film studio Warner Bros Pictures and other companies involved in the production are also named as defendants.The woman says as a result of the alleged abuse she suffers from extreme embarrassment, shame and fear as well as finding it difficult to trust others.She says she has professional concerns about being named in association with the case as she still works as an actor and fears she could be \"blacklisted in the industry\".She is reported to be seeking unspecified damages from the British actor.The document says she was initially booked for three days but after the assault was not brought back for the following days and only paid for one.She also fears harassment from his followers should her identity be revealed, the papers say.The case has been filed under the Adult Survivor's Act, New York legislation which allows alleged victims of sexual offences for which the statute of limitations has passed to file civil suits for a one-year period between 24 November 2022 and 24 November 2023.Allegations from four women towards Brand were first made in a joint investigation by the Sunday Times, Times and Channel 4's Dispatches.They claimed the actor had sexually assaulted them in the UK and Los Angeles during a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, when he held high-profile jobs at BBC Radio 2, Channel 4 and as a Hollywood actor.Since then the Metropolitan Police said it was investigating allegations of sexual offences made following media reports about Brand, while Thames Valley Police is also looking into reports of harassment and stalking.A day before the media investigation into Brand was published online, the comedian shared a video on social media where he denied the allegations.In it, he denied \"serious criminal allegations\" he said were to be made against him, and said his relationships \"were absolutely, always consensual\".\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "More than 100 people have been killed after an earthquake struck remote western Nepal on Friday.Security forces have been deployed to help rescue efforts in the rugged districts of Jajarkot and West Rukum, 500km (310 miles) west of Kathmandu.Strong tremors were felt far away in the Nepalese capital and in cities in neighbouring India, including Delhi.The army spokesman said more than 100 people had been injured. Jajarkot's hospital is packed with the wounded.Three more tremors were felt within an hour of the quake, and many people have spent the rest of the night in the open because of fear of further quakes and damage to their houses.Video footage on local media showed crumbled facades of multi-storied brick houses. People were pictured digging through rubble in the dark to pull survivors from the remains of collapsed buildings in posts on social media.Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal arrived in the affected region on Saturday, after expressing his \"deep sorrow\" at the loss of life and property wrought by the quake, on social media platform X. He said he had ordered security agencies to immediately launch rescue and relief operations.But those search and rescue operations are being hampered by roads becoming blocked by landslides that were triggered by the quake.The police chief of Jajarkot district Suresh Sunar told the Reuters news agency it was difficult to get a full picture of what had happened.\"I am out in the open myself. We are collecting details but due to cold and night it is difficult to get information from remote areas,\" Mr Sunar told Reuters.The earthquake was recorded at 23:47 local time (18:02 GMT), according to Nepal's Monitoring and Research Centre.The US Geological Survey measured the earthquake at a magnitude of 5.6, and said it was a shallow earthquake, meaning it happened closer to the earth's surface.Nepal is situated along the Himalayas, where there is a lot of seismic activity.Last month, a 6.3-magnitude earthquake was registered in the western district of Bajhang, resulting in injuries.In 2015, the country suffered two devastating earthquakes in which 9,000 people were killed and 22,309 injured.The first, on 25 April 2015, was a 7.8-magnitude quake which caused most of the damage and loss of life. A large number of aftershocks followed, including one that measured 7.3 in May of that year.The quakes destroyed or damaged more than 800,000 houses mainly in the western and central districts, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).Government buildings, some stretches of roads and Kathmandu Valley's famous historic monuments - Unesco world heritage sites - were destroyed or damaged with many villages north of Kathmandu flattened.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Civilians in the area are repeatedly called upon to evacuate southwards for their own safety,\" it added.BBC Verify studied three videos - one of which is very graphic - and established that they were filmed outside Al-Shifa and were uploaded on Friday afternoon.In one video, people were filmed lying in pools of blood in the road next to vehicles - some were severely injured and some were not moving.There is no crater visible in the footage we've seen so far, and no debris or shrapnel visible. There's damage to the front of an ambulance and some cars on the road have smashed windows.A Hamas government statement said Israeli forces targeted \"a convoy of ambulances which was transporting the wounded\" from Al-Shifa hospital Gaza City towards Rafah in the south.Egypt's health ministry said just 17 wounded Palestinians were evacuated for treatment in Egyptian hospitals on Friday instead of the 28 originally planned because of the \"events\" at Al-Shifa.The head of the World Health Organization said he was \"utterly shocked\" by the explosion at Al-Shifa.\"We reiterate: patients, health workers, facilities and ambulances must be protected at all times. Always,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X.Bisan Owda, a Palestinian filmmaker, was nearby when the attack happened.\"Some people lost their legs, lost their hands, people were trying to carry injuries,\" she told the BBC. \"People were crying, trying to find each other.\"In addition to the patients at Al-Shifa, thousands more people are sheltering from Israeli air strikes there.Ms Owda said many were unable to find space inside the hospital and were sleeping in nearby streets,\"They are sitting outside because there is no places in the Al-Shifa. They bomb the place outside. They bomb the door. I`ve been there just before, two minutes. It could be me,\" she said.The Israeli military says there is a major Hamas headquarters situated underneath the hospital.Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas killed more than 1,400 people in Israel and kidnapped more than 240 others.It has also launched a ground operation and on Thursday said its forces had encircled Gaza City.Israel has warned people to move to the south of the Gaza Strip and hundreds of thousands have left Gaza City and northern areas. But many thousands remain in northern Gaza.Continued Israeli air strikes in the southern Gaza Strip, where Israel had told Gazans to go, as well as overcrowded conditions there have prompted some Palestinians to return to their homes in northern Gaza,The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 9,000 people have been killed in the Gaza Strip since 7 October.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "The Times reports that Britain's chief rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, believes pro-Palestinian protesters are \"standing alongside\" extremists.Speaking ahead of marches planned for Armistice Day next weekend, he tells the paper it is \"a stain on our common humanity\" that so many seem to have \"lost sight of the moral distance between Hamas and Israel\".The Daily Express echoes warnings from some Conservative MPs that the Cenotaph in Whitehall and other war memorials are at risk of being desecrated. \"Hate Marches Are Affront To British Values\" is the headline. The paper says it understands the prime minister does not want the protest in London to go ahead \"at all\".The Guardian quotes a senior Metropolitan Police officer saying the march's organisers have assured the force they have no intention of causing disruption to Remembrance events.Elsewhere, the Daily Mail has revelations from a book written by the former Cabinet minister, Nadine Dorries.The Plot: The Political Assassination of Boris Johnson claims the Conservatives have been controlled for two decades by a cabal known as the \"movement\" - which ultimately toppled Mr Johnson as prime minister, and undermined others including Liz Truss and Theresa May.The Daily Mail - which is serialising the book - says Ms Dorries identifies Michael Gove as the main actor, because he \"binds all the dark-arts people together\". A source close to Mr Gove tells the newspaper: \"Nadine is a very talented bestselling fiction author.\"The i reports that the shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves has received the backing of the former Conservative chancellor Lord Clarke, in an apparent boost for Labour. It says the Tory grandee has sparked backlash in his own party after praising her \"uncompromising approach\".The paper says Ms Reeves - a former chess champion - has likened the battle with the Conservatives to the latter stages of a board game. It quotes her as saying Labour is \"ahead\", but playing an opponent \"who usually beats you\".The Daily Telegraph leads with a report that the BBC is facing a \u00c2\u00a31.7bn bill triggered by what it calls \"gold-plated pensions\".The paper says the corporation is now locked in a legal battle to try to reduce pension payouts. The BBC says it is reviewing its pension options in the interests of both its staff and licence fee payers.Several papers picture the Beatles in a new music video, after the release of Now And Then - which is being billed as their last ever song.The Times says they got \"A Little Help\" from the director of the Lord of the Rings, Sir Peter Jackson, who superimposed archive footage of John Lennon and George Harrison, with new shots of the surviving members, Sir Ringo Starr and Sir Paul McCartney.The Daily Mirror says fans went \"from Penny Lane to Memory Lane\". It quotes Sir Peter saying George's son \"welled up\" when they talked about the video's ending - the last moments show the Beatles bowing on a stage in black and white before they disappear.Sign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "A foundation has been set up in the name of late actor Matthew Perry to help those struggling with addiction.Perry, who was best known for playing Chandler in TV sitcom Friends, died last weekend at the age of 54.The star battled addictions to alcohol and drugs for much of his adult life.A statement from the Matthew Perry Foundation said it was \"the realisation of Matthew's enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction\".It added: \"In the spirit of Matthew Perry's enduring commitment to helping others struggling with the disease of addiction, we embark on a journey to honour his legacy by establishing the Matthew Perry Foundation, guided by his own words and experiences, and driven by his passion for making a difference in as many lives as possible.\"The foundation's website also features one of Perry's quotes, which has been widely circulated since his death.\"When I die, I don't want Friends to be the first thing that's mentioned,\" he said last year. \"I want helping others to be the first thing that's mentioned. And I'm going to live the rest of my life proving that.\"It also has another quote from his 2022 memoir: \"Addiction is far too powerful for anyone to defeat alone. But together, one day at a time, we can beat it down.\"A spokesman for the National Philanthropic Trust, which helps not-for-profit organisations raise money, confirmed it was managing the new fund.Perry's funeral is understood to have taken place in Los Angeles on Friday with US reports saying his Friends co-stars David Schwimmer, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc and Lisa Kudrow were all in attendance.Perry was found dead in a hot tub in his Los Angeles home on 28 October. A post mortem examination was inconclusive and officials are awaiting the results of toxicology tests.Friends co-creator Marta Kauffman said she spoke to him two weeks ago and he was \"in a really good place, which is why this seems so unfair\".She told NBC's Today show: \"He wanted to help other addicts and it gave him purpose.\"Friends co-creator David Crane agreed that helping other addicts \"absolutely became his purpose, his reason for being\".Perry turned his $10m Malibu beach compound into Perry House, a men's sober living facility, in 2012, and the project received an award from the White House the following year.He sold it two years later but said he was still committed to providing services for recovering addicts.Others paying tribute in recent days have included fellow actor Hank Azaria, who said Perry had been like a \"brother\" and helped him stop drinking.In a video posted on Instagram, he said: \"The night I went into AA [Alcoholics Anonymous], Matthew brought me in.\"The whole first year I was sober, we went to meetings together and he was such a great... I got to tell him this. As a sober person he was so caring and giving and wise and he totally helped me get sober.\"In a joint statement released on Monday, Perry's five Friends co-stars said they were \"all so utterly devastated\" by the news of his death.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "Sexual consent and the \"gap in understanding\" about what sexual assault actually means is the subject of Molly Manning Walker's visceral debut feature film, How to Have Sex.It is fair to say the rising star of British cinema has not taken the easy route.The 30-year-old, who trained as a cinematographer, both wrote and directed her debut, which follows three female teens who excitedly head to a party town in Crete to celebrate the end of their GCSEs.But while the exuberance of youth is gloriously celebrated in the bars and clubs of Malia, there is a dark underbelly to this tale of self-discovery as the trio navigate sex and consent.Warning: themes of a sexual nature and discussion of sexual assault discussed below.Persuasion actress Mia McKenna-Bruce takes the leading role as Tara, who is self-conscious about still being a virgin and finds herself in uncharted territory on a night out.Manning Walker says the idea for the story came from a \"formative memory\" she has of seeing a man being given oral sex on stage during a bar crawl on a holiday she went on as a teenager.\"I started writing from there. We spent a bit of time in Malia doing research. We really tried to... engage with real life and what was going on. And then we did some workshops where we talked to 16-year-olds and their concept of consent, and it was quite wild what came out of that.\"Without giving too much away, Tara finds herself in two dangerous situations with one of the lads from the group staying in the apartment next door.\"For me, every woman I know has been sexually assaulted and not every man I know would claim to have had that experience or to have been a perpetrator. So I think there's a real gap there in what people understand as assault,\" says Manning Walker.\"And I think that's where we have to open the conversation up to allow men and women to discuss what's going on.\"The film focuses on not just the perpetrator, Paddy (Samuel Bottomley), but also his mate, Badger (Shaun Thomas) who develops a genuine friendship with Tara.Manning Walker said: \"It was really important that we don't lock men out of the conversation. I wanted men to recognise themselves in the characters and although Badger is really fun...and sweet, he fails her [Tara] and he doesn't stand up at the right moment.\"He kind of enables his mate to continue the behaviour. And I think that's [what] we're trying to talk about ... don't assault people, that should be obvious. But... let's talk about stuff with our friends, let's care for other people. Let's make kindness more forefront in our lives.\"While the film tackles a serious subject, it's certainly not all bleak.The film has some powerful shifts in tone, with switch-ups between light and dark, fun and fear, pure joy and intense despair.Carefree moments are often quickly tempered with a growing tension that builds to a crescendo.Manning Walker explains: \"We designed the film in two halves. The first half is meant to be like this fun girls' holiday, escapism, light and airy.\"And then there's the second half. The camera style changes. Everything's dirty or more [expletive] up and the intensity of the performances... everyone feels it. The base [music] gets deeper and darker, the crickets actually get louder and faster in the background. And this intensity just keeps going throughout the film.\"The director is keen to point out that while Malia is a vehicle for the movie's narrative, sexual assault can obviously happen anywhere, not just on hedonistic group trips abroad.\"I don't want to put too much blame on these holidays because I had some of the best times of my life [on these types of trips]. These kind of things happen in all circumstances like in London in clubs, or when you go camping, or at music festivals. It happens wherever.\"The complexity of playing the role of Tara, who goes through so many mixed emotions and is fundamentally changed by the film's conclusion, was a challenge McKenna-Bruce relished.She modestly stresses that her authentic performance was down to the camaraderie of the close-knit team of cast and crew, fostered by Manning Walker.\"It's 100% down to Molly and the cast. We all connected on a really, really deep level. The set in itself was super-supportive, super-safe from the get-go.\"As is common practice in the modern-day film industry, the production employed an intimacy co-ordinator, who protects and guides actors filming intimate scenes.\"It was the first time I've worked with an intimacy co-ordinator, which is insane,\" McKenna-Bruce tells me.\"To me, it's crazy to think that you wouldn't have intimacy co-ordinators in the same way that you'd have stunt co-ordinators. You wouldn't expect someone to do a fight without a stunt co-ordinator. We choreographed everything to a tee.\"The film also tackles toxic female friendship and peer pressure, with Tara's friend Skye (Lara Peake) often putting her down and making fun of her lack of sexual experience.\"I didn't want it to be just coming from the men. I wanted it to come from all angles,\" says Manning Walker.\"We get to see those glimpses with Skye, like her mum not being present,\" says McKenna-Bruce.\"It's projection and you allow yourself to take these jabs from people for their benefit. And that's something that you don't have to do.\"While secondary schools do teach consent as part of the RSHE curriculum, Manning Walker thinks more could be done.\"It's so binary, so law-based and for me, I'm like, 'you have to stop thinking \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 the police are going to protect us'.\"We're trying to get a sex education situation going, we really want to take it [the film] into schools,\" she adds.She said: \"We've had amazing experiences, like an older man watched it and said that he realised that he'd been Paddy, and also young people saying thank you for making something that makes us feel so seen.\"The Schools Consent Project sends lawyers into schools to teach consent to 11 to 18-year-olds.Founder Kate Parker told the BBC: \"Films like How to Have Sex are essential in bringing these conversations to a wider audience.\"Consent can often be seen as a clunky legal term; these sorts of films reframe it in a disarmingly relatable way. They encourage their audiences to really scrutinise what consent looks and feels like, what a violation is, how to articulate that, and what to do when other factors are involved: alcohol, drugs, peer pressure, etc.\"Daniel Guinness of Beyond Equality, a charity that helps boys and men rethink masculinity to empower them, says:\"It's important for men to understand that they also have the right and the ability to give their consent or not give their consent to things.\"And it's [also] important for men and boys, because at the moment, they are the ones who are perpetrating more of the sexual violence. It's really important they're very aware about the need for them to be checking in with any partner that they have.\"And while controversial influencers such as Andrew Tate have arguably made conversations around consent more difficult for young people, McKenna-Ball is glad women's voices are being heard.\"I think with voices like Molly's in the industry, that in itself is moving forward. I feel like this didn't exist for me growing up. So the fact that it does now is a step in the right direction.\"Obviously [there's] a lot further to go... as much as there's a lot that's still very, very hard to deal with and frustrating, there is movement and there is light at the end of the tunnel.\"If you have been affected by any of the issues discussed in this story you can find help and support at BBC Action Line.Additional reporting by Rebecca Swash.How to Have Sex is available on streaming service Mubi from Friday 3 November.\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

    "China and Australia are proof that governments do not have to like each other to do business.When Anthony Albanese arrives in China on Saturday, he will be the first Australian prime minister to visit in seven years.His three-day trip comes in the wake of plummeting relations between the two countries - and Canberra's growing military ties with Washington.In recent years Australia and China have accused each other over human rights violations and perceived threats to national security. Public perceptions of the other side are more negative than they have ever been.But when it comes to trade, they cannot afford to let go of each other. At the peak of their trading relationship in 2020, almost half of Australia's exports went to China.By way of comparison, at around the same time roughly 9% of all US exports and only 5% of British exports were being sold to China.This kind of leverage can be a powerful tool if a government wants to make a point, which is what happened in 2020 when Australia called for an independent inquiry into the origins of Covid-19.\"That was deeply upsetting to the Chinese government,\" said Jane Golley, an economist at the Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra.\"Shortly after, the [Chinese] ambassador here gave a speech and suggested that some Australian industries might suffer as a consequence.\"Sure enough, a string of Chinese tariffs and restrictions followed on an estimated $20bn (\u00c2\u00a316.4bn) worth of Australian goods. Among the many products affected were barley, beef, wine, coal, timber and lobster.\"Basically the Chinese government was sending a message. They were unhappy with the Australian government and decided to use economic coercion to make that point,\" Professor Golley added.At the time, such a robust move from an important trading partner was a surprise to many. Since then, China has reversed many of the restrictions.The decision to row back on the tariffs was, at least partly, helped by a change of tack from the newly elected Australian government.Shortly after meeting with China's leader Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Bali last year, Mr Albanese said: \"We're always going to be better off when we have dialogue and are able to talk constructively and respectfully\".He reminded Australians that trade with China was worth more than with Japan, the US and South Korea combined. Clearly, normalising relations between what he called \"two highly complementary economies\" would be a priority for his government.Whether China's so-called economic coercion was successful is doubtful. Australia is still openly critical of Beijing on several fronts - but there is no question that Australian businesses and workers took a hit because of China's trade restrictions.\"We can't live without them, essentially,\" Professor Golley said. \"I think the Albanese government clearly decided that our economic links were too important to sacrifice and went for an improvement in our diplomacy.\"Australia has its own levers it can use to its advantage - especially when it comes to natural resources.\"China and Australia are deeply economically interdependent,\" said Benjamin Herscovitch, a research fellow at the ANU's National Security College.Typically, China has been, and still is, highly reliant on Australia for raw materials to satisfy its vast and growing economy.Huge amounts of its iron ore and liquefied natural gas, for example, come from Australia. Incidentally, neither of these commodities were subjected to Chinese restrictions.The Chinese public can live without Australian wine and lobsters, but until the country is able to adequately source materials to make steel or power its factories, Beijing knows it is not in a strong position to start making demands of Australia.Some analysts argue that China's trade restrictions were not forcing Canberra closer to Beijing - rather they had the opposite effect.\"The Chinese government started to realise that its coercive economic and diplomatic measures were driving Australia closer to the United States,\" said Mr Herscovitch.\"Beijing's decision to remove trade restrictions and normalise diplomatic contact is aimed at wooing Canberra away from Washington.\"One aim could be to gain Australian support for entry into the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).This is the successor to the doomed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) - the free trade agreement from which then-US President Donald Trump withdrew. So far several countries, including Australia, have blocked China's attempts to join.\"To be blunt, China doesn't have that many friends in the world. We used to be one, but not anymore,\" Professor Golley said. \"If you think about it, it makes sense to have a strong economic relationship with an ally of the United States. If you're being cynical, it gives you an opportunity to drive a wedge between us and Washington.\"Given the heightened tensions with the US, it makes sense that China does not want to alienate America's allies.Not only is Washington trying to exclude China from access to technology needed for advanced computer chips and critical minerals needed for green energy, it is also putting pressure on its allies to do the same.Half of the world's lithium, for example, is in Australia. Chinese companies want access to such metals that are crucial for making electric vehicles, a field in which China is currently the global leader.According to Professor Golley, there is a danger that Australia and China become \"competitors rather than collaborators\" when it comes to issues they need to work together on, such as fighting climate change.Australia's close political and military ties with the US mean it will inevitably fall on the American side of the superpower struggle.But siding with a country whose economic policies actively harm China will only put more strain on the relationship and could risk landing both countries back at square one.\"I don't know how much longer this can continue\", said Professor Golley. \"The Australian government wants a relationship with China in which, basically, we continue to export to them as normal.\"\"But at the same time we also diversify away from them and restrict their capital flows into the country. To me, that sounds like we want to have our cake and eat it too.\"\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.": {
