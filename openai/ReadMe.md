# DEMO-Tutorial: Langchain

Be sure to update the.env file with your OpenAI API Key. Change the file extension from 'env' to '.env' to render it hidden.

### Getting Started

To get started, install the needed dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai chromadb pdf2image langchain streamlit pypdf tiktoken
```

```bash
pip install langchain langchain_experimental
```

- `Thesis Query`: You can also try hugging face LLM by changing the commented out line in *doc_query.py* from 29 to 28.

When run as python files, those that use *streamlit* will prompt you to run it with streamlit run filename.py
